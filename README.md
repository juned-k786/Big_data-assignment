# Big Data Assignment 

## Overview  
This repository contains solutions and implementations related to Big Data concepts, including:  
- Trade-offs in system architecture  
- Search methods for large datasets  
- Random number generation using `return` vs. `yield`  
- Sorting techniques including Merge Sort, Batch Processing, and MapReduce  

## Contents  
- **Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)**: Contains the coding implementations  
- **Word Document (`.docx`)**: Theoretical explanations of Big Data concepts  
- **Dataset (`inr_usd_exchange.csv`)**: Used for analysis in assignments  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Apache Spark  
- Hadoop MapReduce  
- Pandas & NumPy  

## How to Run  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juned-k786/Big_data-assignment.git
## pip install pandas numpy
Install dependencies (if required):
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy
Open the Jupyter notebooks and execute the cells.
## Key Observations
Return vs. Yield: Yield is memory efficient for Big Data processing.
Merge Sort vs. MapReduce: MapReduce is optimal for distributed sorting.
Batch Processing vs. Stream Processing: Trade-offs in performance and complexity.
